# Abstract Binding Trees

This is an OCaml implementation of many-sorted abstract binding trees. Abstract
binding trees (ABTs) are similar to abstract syntax trees, but also keep track
of variable scopes. Many-sorted ABTs support multiple syntactic classes, known
as sorts. This library uses GADTs and phantom types to statically ensure that
only syntactically valid ABTs are representable.

ABTs are described in Robert Harper's textbook, [Practical Foundations for
Programming Languages](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/index.html), and are
inspired by the notation of the [Nuprl proof development system](
http://www.nuprl.org/).
