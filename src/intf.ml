type (_, _) eq =
  | Refl : ('a, 'a) eq (** Proof that ['a] and ['a] are equal. *)
(** [('a, 'b) eq] is the proposition that ['a] and ['b] are equal. *)

type 'sort ar = Arity of 'sort [@@ocaml.unbox]
(** A helper type for specifying arities. *)

type 'sort va = Valence of 'sort [@@ocaml.unbox]
(** A helper type for specifying valences. *)

(** The {i arity} of an operator typically consists of a sequence of sorts
    {i s{_ 1}, ..., s{_ n}} describing the operator's parameters, and the sort
    {i s} that the operator belongs to. The arity usually takes the form
    {i s{_ 1} × ... × s{_ n} → s}.

    Abstract binding trees record variables that are bound in the scope of a
    term. Therefore, operands have a {i valence}, which lists the sorts of the
    variables bound in the operand in addition to the sort of the operand
    itself. The valence takes the form {i s{_ 1} × ... × s{_ k} → s}, where
    {i s{_ 1}, ..., s{_ k}} are the sorts of the variables and {i s} is the
    sort of the operand.

    As a result, the arity for an operator of an abstract binding tree really
    takes the form {i v{_ 1} × ... × v{_ n} → s} where each {i v{_ i}} is a
    valence.

    Throughout this library, the ['valence] type parameter takes the form
    ['s1 -> ... 'sk -> 's va] where each ['si] is the sort of a bound variable
    and ['s] is the sort of the operand, and the ['arity] type parameter takes
    the form ['v1 -> ... -> 'vn -> 's ar], where each ['vi] is a valence of
    of an operand and ['s] is the sort of the operator. *)
