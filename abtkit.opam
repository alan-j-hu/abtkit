synopsis: "Strongly typed many-sorted abstract binding trees (ABTs)"
description: """
Abtkit is an implementation of many-sorted abstract binding trees. Abstract
binding trees (ABTs) are similar to abstract syntax trees, but also keep track
of variable scopes. Many-sorted ABTs support multiple syntactic classes, known
as sorts. This library uses GADTs and phantom types to statically ensure that
only syntactically valid ABTs are representable."""
